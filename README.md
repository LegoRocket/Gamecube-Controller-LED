# Gamecube-Controller-LED [![CC BY-NC-SA 4.0][cc-by-nc-sa-shield]][cc-by-nc-sa]
A modded Gamecube controllers, to have all the original button colours, but in a LED form instead.

A simple project, however it still is a project I am proud of. The mod still holds up today, and is a simple but interesting mod. While some controller mods are excessive and extravagent, this was a simple mod to make it unique, but not distasteful.

Originally this was posted as an [instructables guide.](https://www.instructables.com/Gamecube-Controller-LED-Mod/) It has been posted here to consolodate my creations together.
